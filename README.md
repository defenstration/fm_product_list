## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) - Vite

### What I learned

Where to start. This is my first project using React and Vite. I didn't start the project with that in mind, and transferred the project over from Vanilla JS to React/Vite. This is the first time I worked on splitting up the app into components, importing and exporting components, using state and context, and structuring my project according to a framework. 

On top of that, I goofed when I ported the project into React. When I went to deploy the project I had no shortage of issues. I had 404 errors, MIME errors, and issues with the links to all of my images. I spent several hours troubleshooting the program (unsuccesfully) before I decided to do a fresh start with Vite. I transferred the app over and there was a LOT less of a headache to get it working. 


### Continued development

There still some tweaks I need to make at the mobile level, and more work to do with the transitions to get them smoothed out. The grid breaks are a bit jarring, and doesn't center currently. Honestly, when I started working on moving this to React, those issues took a back seat. I'm submitting it now because mentally, I need to have a submission.
